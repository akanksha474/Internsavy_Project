It contains internsavy internship projects
# 1. Interface Calculator project:
we define a Calculator interface with four methods: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Then, we implement the interface in the BasicCalculator class.

In the Main class, we create an instance of the BasicCalculator and use a Scanner to read user input for two numbers and the desired operation. Based on the user's choice, we call the appropriate method from the Calculator interface to perform the calculation and display the result.

You can run this code and test the calculator by providing two numbers and selecting an operation. It will perform the calculation and display the result accordingly.

# 2. Temperature Conversion project:
In this user can select their conversion choice (Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Fahrenheit) using the provided options. The temperature input is then read, and the appropriate conversion formula is applied to calculate and display the converted temperature.

# 3. Tic Tac Toe Game project:
It is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 board. The game continues until one of the players wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
